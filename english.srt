00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,080
JANUARY 13, 2096

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,660
Another incompatible one?

3
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,160
No good.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,700
This time, after implanting the copy,

5
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,120
I tried completely blocking the connection.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,580
However, like with the others,

7
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,660
it absorbed Psions from the sample's blood,

8
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:55,080
but then returned instead
of remaining stable inside.

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,040
Then, even with the right attributes,
if they lack strong desires,

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,990
they can't become like us.

11
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,410
Are there people who have no desires?

12
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,620
Are you saying there's another factor?

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,410
We need more samples
to get to the bottom of that.

14
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,410
Bizarre murder incident?

15
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,790
I hear the bodies are drained of blood.

16
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,330
Are we sure they weren't just anemic?

17
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,040
It's rare to see you yawn, Leo.

18
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,200
Yeah, I was up late last night.

19
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,990
Hey, Tatsuya!

20
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,370
Did you see the news yesterday?

21
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,580
News? About the vampire?

22
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,580
Yeah. I think it's a
professional crime organization

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,950
of blood traffickers instead
of organ traffickers.

24
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,080
10% of the victims' blood is gone, right?

25
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,490
My question is why is only 10% taken?

26
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,740
Murder probably isn't the intention.

27
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:30,240
They most likely want to keep the victims alive
and use them as blood factories.

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,490
If that's the case, they wouldn't
have abandoned the bodies in town.

29
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:38,540
Besides, there are no wounds on any
of the bodies where blood was taken from.

30
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,700
I see.

31
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,410
You're right. It is strange
that the bodies have no marks like that.

32
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:53,240
Maybe an occult being did it
like they're saying on TV.

33
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,080
An occult being...

34
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,240
Mikihiko...

35
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,370
Do you think a supernatural creature
or some kind of monster is responsible?

36
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,410
I don't believe a normal human
is behind it, but I can't rule it out.

37
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,200
Speaking of the occult,

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,870
that's what magic was considered
to be until just 100 years ago.

39
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,240
Tatsuya, do you think a magician
is committing these crimes?

40
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,660
We can't discount that possibility, either.

41
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,200
Please not that.

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,370
Like with the humanists, there's this
trending idea to expunge magicians from society,

43
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,990
and I don't want it to gain any popularity.

44
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,620
I don't see Lina here.

45
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,620
No, Brother.

46
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,790
She had some emergency at home,
so she's absent today.

47
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,910
That reminds me...

48
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,450
I wonder how Shizuku is doing.

49
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,830
Well...

50
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,700
I talked to her on the phone
again for a bit last night...

51
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,490
And she was surprised
by the vampire serial murder news, too.

52
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,200
She said something similar
is happening in America, too.

53
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,450
Really?

54
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:15,700
Yeah. Not on the West Coast where Shizuku is,
but in the Dallas area, in the Southwest.

55
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,290
That's the first I've heard of it.

56
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,200
She didn't see it on the news.
Another exchange student told her about it.

57
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,740
Oh, I see.

58
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,290
JANUARY 15, 2096

59
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,870
Silvia here.

60
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,910
Hunter Q, Hunter R, report.

61
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,160
Currently tracking,
heading toward West Shibuya.

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,410
Hold on. I'm picking up a response.

63
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,200
The subject is in an empty lot
500 meters ahead of you.

64
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,740
I'm showing one person.
Use the pincer movement.

65
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,450
Roger.

66
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,830
I'll take the right.

67
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,080
Roger.

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,410
The military pursuit team is closing in.

69
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,490
I know.

70
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,450
Just two Stardust members.
They're taking me lightly.

71
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,620
That's because they only know
your previous self.

72
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,080
That makes sense.

73
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,870
If they only know me
as a Satellite-Class magician,

74
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,540
then I can imagine
what they're going to try with me.

75
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,700
I don't need any backup.

76
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,240
Deimos Second, wanted deserter...

77
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,950
Put your hands up
with your fingers apart.

78
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,910
We were told to eliminate you
as soon as we found you.

79
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,290
But we are authorized to bring you in
with a lower punishment by one degree

80
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,790
if you provide us information
on the other fugitives.

81
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,580
We'll give you ten seconds
to think about it.

82
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,490
No, that isn't necessary.

83
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,790
You two cannot kill me.

84
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,620
Trajectory Distortion Spell?

85
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,200
The Cast Jammer isn't working?

86
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,910
Well, there's nothing wrong
with the Cast Jammer. It's just that...

87
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,370
I no longer need a CAD.

88
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,790
You can change
the trajectory of my knife?

89
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,040
How can you use
powerful magic like that?

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,410
You can't fathom it?
I'm not the man I was before.

91
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,950
Bull!

92
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,540
Die!

93
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,290
Vector Reflection Spell? This strength...

94
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,450
Angie Sirius?

95
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,910
This Psionic wave pattern...

96
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,790
Hey, are you okay?

97
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,410
That hurt!

98
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,200
Are you wearing carbon armor
under that coat?

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,160
Makes all the difference.

100
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,040
Panzer!

101
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,040
What the... I'm losing my strength...

102
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,790
Dammit! Take this!

103
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,080
That one punch was effective.

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,950
But...

105
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,790
it wasn't a decisive blow.

106
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,370
Caster Jamming? No, this is...

107
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,660
Major, what's wrong?

108
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,330
I lost sight of the subject.

109
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
"VISITOR ARC II"

110
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,580
JANUARY 16, 2096

111
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,120
Everyone got here early, huh?

112
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,160
You guys saw me at my lamest.

113
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,410
You were put through the wringer.

114
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,450
I mean, you don't look physically injured...

115
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,790
so what happened?

116
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,540
I don't really know.

117
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,830
We were slugging it out, and then,
all of a sudden, I was weak as a kitten.

118
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:18,200
Luckily, Erika's big brother, the police chief,
found me passed out on the ground.

119
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,620
And you weren't poisoned, right?

120
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,330
Nope. The blood test came back negative.

121
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,740
Did you get a good look
at your opponent?

122
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,830
I saw, but I wouldn't say
I got a good look.

123
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,240
There was a hat pulled down low,
a totally white mask, a long coat,

124
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,990
and under that, hardened body armor.

125
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,620
So, I can't tell you anything
about looks or body type.

126
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,830
Except...

127
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,120
I had a feeling it was a woman.

128
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,290
A woman held her own
against you in a fistfight?

129
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,490
Well, it's not like that's impossible.

130
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,620
Even an elementary school girl could strangle
a big man to death if she drugged him first.

131
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,120
True.

132
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,330
But it's also possible
that she wasn't a normal human.

133
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,120
Do you know something about it?

134
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,160
I think Leo ran into a parasite.

135
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,290
Parasite... Like a worm?

136
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,080
Paranormal parasite. A supernatural bug.

137
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,450
Or just "parasite" for short.

138
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,240
Specter, evil spirit, jinn, demon...

139
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,790
Things that are ascribed various notions in
countries all over the world, but essentially,

140
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,540
they're things with magical
properties that latch on to people

141
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,240
and turn them into something
other than human.

142
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
Is that what a vampire really is?

143
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,990
Leo...

144
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,080
Yeah?

145
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,830
Can I take a look at your ethereal body?

146
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,160
Ethereal body?

147
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,490
The ethereal body is spirit energy.
In other words, a bundle of life force.

148
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,580
It's thought that...

149
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,950
monsters that eat human flesh absorb
spirit energy through the blood and meat...

150
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,490
and nourish themselves.

151
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,790
Vampires drink blood,

152
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:11,410
but is it really the spirit energy
they absorb with it that they need?

153
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,450
Yes. But if we're talking
non-physical creatures,

154
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,290
all they should need
is just the spirit energy itself.

155
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,540
I see.

156
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,040
So, it wouldn't be crazy to have vampires
that only absorbed spirit energy.

157
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,450
If Leo lets me examine his ethereal body,
I should be able to see what was done to him.

158
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,240
To be honest,

159
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,830
right from the beginning, I didn't think
these vampire slayings were just bizarre crimes.

160
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,040
That's what my intuition
as an old caster told me.

161
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,950
It's just that I didn't have
any proof until now,

162
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,120
so I didn't bring the parasites up.

163
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
But because of my reluctance,
Leo was attacked...

164
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,120
Go ahead.

165
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,490
Do it, Mikihiko.

166
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,990
Are you sure?

167
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah!

168
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,370
Investigate all you like!

169
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,040
Did you find anything?

170
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,540
Leo, are you...

171
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,990
really human?

172
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,370
Hey, that's a fine response.

173
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,200
I mean, if a normal caster
had this much spirit energy stolen...

174
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,330
they'd be comatose right now.

175
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:34,450
But the fact that you can sit up and talk
just goes to show your high level of endurance.

176
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,910
What can I say?
My body's made of strong stuff. So...

177
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,240
we're saying I lost my strength last night

178
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,490
because the masked woman
leeched my spirit energy?

179
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,540
I think so.

180
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,910
But...

181
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,540
if she could absorb your spirit energy
just through touching you alone,

182
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,790
there should've been no need
for her to steal your blood, too.

183
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,700
Why did this parasite
go to the trouble of taking blood?

184
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,160
Will Leo be all right?

185
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,120
I'm worried.

186
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,740
I hope he recovers soon.

187
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,160
Mikihiko...

188
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:27,240
I forgot to ask you this before,
but are these parasites really that common?

189
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,580
No. They appear very rarely.

190
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,910
But this real demon is responsible
for the vampire murders, right?

191
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,410
I believe so.

192
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,120
Do you think it's a coincidence?

193
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,740
Certainly, historically,
the closer to the modern age you go,

194
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,040
the frequency of recorded observations
of demons decreases.

195
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,830
It's a stretch to think
these are just random murders.

196
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,620
Well, I know the truth.

197
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,990
You're a real trouper.

198
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,870
A genuine compliment from you...
I'll take it.

199
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,660
I gave you a genuine compliment.

200
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,290
Brother!

201
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,740
You were listening to that, weren't you?

202
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,740
It was fascinating.

203
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,330
So, if Yoshida's second son's hypothesis
is right, what are you going to do?

204
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,740
In a situation like this,
it doesn't matter whether he's right or wrong.

205
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,200
Even if it's only for a short time, anyone
who steps through the Chiba Gate is our pupil.

206
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,290
And I'm the one who taught
the basics of that technique.

207
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,080
We're talking my pupil here,
so I can't just do nothing!

208
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,410
Such a cold reason.

209
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,620
It doesn't need to be anything else.

210
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,950
I don't know if this vampire
is a man or woman,

211
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,540
but if it wants a fight, I'll give it one!

212

MAXIMILLIAN DEVICES - TOKYO BRANCH OFFICE

213
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,330
Report, please.

214
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,200
Yes, ma'am.

215
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:20,740
After cornering Deimos Second,
we used a Caster Jammer to block his CAD.

216
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,990
But it didn't work on him.

217
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,740
The Caster Jammer wasn't working?

218
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,870
No, it operated normally.

219
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,290
Deimos Second claimed...

220
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,870
that he didn't need CAD anymore.

221
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,790
He doesn't need CAD anymore...

222
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,740
Are you saying
Sergeant Sullivan became psychic?

223
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,240
Affirmative.

224
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,490
But his Psionic wave properties
didn't change, right?

225
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,660
We would've recognized it if it did.

226
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,240
While I was pursuing Sergeant Sullivan,

227
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,740
I came into contact with someone
who appeared to be his partner.

228
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,040
Weren't you able to measure
that person's Psionic wave properties?

229
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,870
I'm sorry.

230
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,790
We were only able to recognize
the Psionic waves of Deimos Second and yours.

231
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,660
I see.

232
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:25,580
Going forth, when we're tracking down a fugitive,
try to refrain from engaging with them.

233
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,410
I'll deal with that part.

234
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,290
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,330
The chasers weren't able to
identify White Mask's Psi-waves.

236
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,870
Really?

237
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,200
It seems the fugitives
have all gained various abilities.

238
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,870
I wish I could just stay like that.

239
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,660
It's easier to maintain Parade
than hide my magic use.

240
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,990
Anyway...

241
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,200
I wonder why they're attacking
Japanese people.

242
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,330
Why?

243
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,450
They're being pursued.

244
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,700
You'd think they would want
to stay underground as much as possible.

245
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,830
I don't have the answer to that.

246
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,200
But...

247
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,040
But what?

248
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,040
I have a feeling it's related
to the strange ability they've gained.

249
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,830
Strange ability...

250
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,700
You mean the vampire power,
stealing blood without leaving a wound?

251
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,040
I don't know if "vampire"
is the right word, but...

252
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,790
Lina? I'm going to draw the curtain.

253
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,620
What are you doing?

254
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,290
Oh, this is just...

"FIRST HIGH SCHOOL EXTRACURRICULAR
ACTIVITIES FEDERATION HEADQUARTERS"

256
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,990
Now, someone from our school
has fallen victim to the vampire incident.

257
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,200
It's Leonhard Saijo of Class 1-E.

258
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,700
Yes, I've heard.

259
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,700
As far as my family
has been able to determine,

260
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,740
the vampire has left 24 victims
so far including Saijo.

261
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,910
Three times what the media has reported.

262
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,540
Were all of them in Tokyo and the suburbs?

263
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,870
Just the Tokyo metro area
and concentrated in the inner city.

264
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,700
The police aren't aware of all the victims,
but the Saegusa Family is...

265
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,700
Is one of the victims
related to your family?

266
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,660
You're half-right.

267
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,580
The victims that the police don't know about
are all magicians who have helped us.

268
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:49,950
Apparently, all the other victims
were either magicians or had magic potential.

269
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,410
Are you saying the killer is hunting magicians?

270
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,080
Jumonji, you're scaring me.

271
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,240
Sorry.

272
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,290
Anyway, I think we can say
the vampire is targeting magicians.

273
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,990
If the killer has the ability
to harm Saegusa magicians,

274
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,040
then it's most likely a super soldier
or another magician.

275
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,990
And odds are the killer is a foreigner.

276
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,080
Have any suspicious
foreigners entered the country

277
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,870
around the time the killings started?

278
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,580
Good question.

279
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:34,740
There are quite a few overseas magician students
and magic technicians from the USNA in Japan.

280
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,580
We have one exchange student
here at our school, too, but...

281
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,700
do you think she's suspicious, Jumonji?

282
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,290
Suspicious, yes, but not the killer.

283
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,990
I have a feeling
she's got something to do with it,

284
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,410
but for now, I think
we can put her on the back burner.

285
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,660
Jumonji, I have a message from my father,

286
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,910
or rather, Koichi Saegusa,
the head of the Saegusa Family.

287
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,370
The Saegusa Family wishes to have
an alliance with the Jumonji Family.

288
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,200
After having our discussion,

289
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,080
I realized that this is not a situation
the Jumonji Family can ignore, either.

290
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,490
We will cooperate with you.

291
